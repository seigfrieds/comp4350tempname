## Project Summary & Vision

__OurCity__ will be a web application that provides users with an alternative to raising municipal concerns and making general quality of life suggestions, with the goal of making Winnipeg a stronger city.

While Winnipeg has 311, it is mainly for getting information about already existing city services, making service requests, and reporting various issues (e.g. potholes). We lack a definitive, easy-to-use platform where suggestions for new projects can be made to improve our overall quality of life. For that, currently, citizens of Winnipeg either have to email or call their local representatives. This can be inefficient and time-consuming, which results in many people not even bothering to voice their ideas. Some citizens also try to raise suggestions on various social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook, but these platforms lack legitimacy and/or a clear, singular focus on taking proposals.

OurCity remedies this by providing an official hub for the citizens. It will allow users to create forum-like posts that contain their municipal suggestions (e.g. my neighborhood is lacking a modern recreational center) where other users can interact with each other through interactions like comments and upvotes. This provides an efficient way to keep track of issues and encourages people from the community to have lively discussions. Posts that meet or pass a certain user approval threshold can then be raised to their respective city representatives.

### Core Non-Functional Feature: Handle Heavier Loads

For our non-functional feature, we want to be able to handle 125 users with 1250 concurrent requests per minute. 
- One way we plan to boost our backend’s performance is by caching frequently accessed data for quicker response times.

### Nice-To-Have Features

- Polls and Surveys
  - City officials will be able to run polls and surveys themselves to gather feedback and increase community involvement even more.
- Social Features
  - Users can follow other accounts and form groups/communities to author posts together (e.g. neighborhood of Transcona makes a post together)
- Accessibility
  - Grammar checkers, French translations, voice readers, and more will be added to the site.

## Initial Architecture

![Alt text](./initial_architecture_diagram.jpg)

__Primary Frontend:__ Vue 

__Secondary Frontend:__ React

__Backend Server:__ ASP.NET Core

__Data Layer:__ PostgreSQL, Redis

__Our application is currently planned to be a website.__

### Why do we think this architecture will work well?

We chose Vue for our primary frontend as we believe it has a great developer experience, and its simplicity and gentle learning curve will make it easy to pick up for those that have not used it before. For the secondary frontend, we selected React, as the majority of our team has prior experience with it, and it is a well-supported frontend library with a large community. These frameworks will be backed by TypeScript over traditional JavaScript for its strong typing which will help maintainability across both our frontends.

For our backend, we chose ASP.NET Core (C#) to create our server as it is a mature, flexible framework that is known to have built strong web APIs throughout the world, and its extensive set of libraries will help us to reach our goals. We anticipate that our application will have lots of relational data, so we chose PostgreSQL as our database as it has a large community, is free-to-use, integrates well with .NET, and has robust functionality such as JSON support and advanced indexing. We also plan to use Redis as a reliable, industry-standard cache that will help when there’s increased activity.

By having an architecture that defines clear separation between the components of our application, we will have a codebase that is easier to reason about, easier to test, and easier to scale.

## Work Division & Coordination

#### Division of Tasks
At the start of every sprint, we will hold one or two sprint planning meetings to plan out our work. To understand what is important and ensure everybody is getting equal amounts of work, we will decide the priority of each ticket and estimate effort based on time. When assigning tickets, we will take into account each member’s strengths, but we plan to encourage a sharing of knowledge and experience across our different features and parts of the tech stack, so as to not pigeonhole people into certain roles (e.g. strictly a backend developer).

#### Work Coordination
We have scheduled two weekly meetings on Monday and Thursday, with availability for extra impromptu meetings if needed. These meetings will vary in length and content based on where we are in the sprint, but all of them will have a consistent emphasis on making sure we are on track to complete our goals. To uphold high code quality, we will have a strong suggestion of 2 reviewers for every single PR to get a variety of perspectives on our code, but we will be flexible.
